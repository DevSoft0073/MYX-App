 MYX pretends to gamify life to make users feel as if they are playing their own life’s game while helping them improve their lives and eventually improve the World.

 Many social apps like Instagram or Snapchat allow users to share their “best part”, bringing competition among users and leading to terrible consequences: low self-love, unhealthy self-comparison, huge distractions… overall they alienate users from their real-life objectives, making them pursue false dreams and fake stereotypes. They are a slot machine of time. Imagine if all the time people spend on these Apps was invested in improving their lives?

 MYX aims to be an App that helps you improve and improve the World. The philosophy behind this App is to consider life as a game. In the game of life, you don’t choose to play, you appear in a particular part of the map and have some socio-economical status and abilities. You play with millions of other players under the same rules. In a videogame you make missions, get rewards and improve your character to get to more difficult missions. However, in life, there are no pre-defined missions or objectives, no clear rewards, and the risk is high ( not like in a video game that you can die several times ) Nevertheless, life’s rewards are usually better than any kind of reward you can get from a video game.

Welcome, dear user!
In this section, you will find relevant information about MYX best practices.

WHAT ARE GAMES AND HOW TO PLAY THEM?

A game is a specific, attainable, and measurable objective that you SET to attain a broader goal and its reward. You define games and track your progress using MYX.
For example:
 Imagine that you want to be shredded: you create a game to attain this objective. A great game would be “go to the gym”, so you create it by navigating to Add Game. Every time you go to the gym you give yourself 1 MYX by going to Add Points. You can track your progress on the Historical Performance screen.
A bad example of a game would be, “be shredded” as it is not clear and specific.

WHAT IS THE MYX MAGNITUDE?

A MYX is an invented unit of measurement that represents the amount of value a person brings to himself.
The more MYX you score the better you will become ;)

RITUALS

We are spiritual beings. Our century is characterized by the lack of religious movements. Nevertheless, we can learn a lot about the instruments religious institutions have used during centuries to move the mass to attain certain things. A ritual is the set of rites and formulas to be observed in a cult; groups a series of actions or practices carried out mainly for their symbolic value. Why don’t you create your own rituals?
Example a Night/Morning ritual: a set of activities you do before going to bed and to get your ass working in the morning.
“When I decide to go to sleep the ritual starts. I set the alarm and leave my phone charging at a proper distance from the bed. I clean my teeth and my face and prepare a glass of water, take my vitamins, and sleep. When I wake up I have to stand up to stop the alarm which prevents me from sleeping again. I drink the glass of water and then clean my teeth and face. Finally, I stretch, meditate for five minutes, and have breakfast.”

let gameIdeaMSG = """
We strongly recommend not to have many ongoing games. Any game is valid. If you have no ideas, you can grab one of MYX’s suggestions to get started.

-Gym / Running / Any physical activity
-Night/Morning Ritual
-Practice particular skill ( piano, photography, video-making, writing, singing, painting, coding… )
-Reading
-Travel / Discover new things
-Weekly Improvement Ideas ( a time for yourself to think about what you did during the week, how could you improve what you did, and get ready for the following week )
-Develop Particular Project
